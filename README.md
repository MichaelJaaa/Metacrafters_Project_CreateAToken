# Metacrafters_Project_CreateAToken
This is a simple "Create a Token" project that is required for the completion of ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are interested and curious about Creating Tokens using the Solidity Programming Language on the Ethereum blockchain.
## Description
This program is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is built with three public variables, one mapping variable, and two functions that either mint or burn tokens. This program serves as an introduction to learn the basic understanding about token creation.
## Getting Started
### Installing
### Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Final_Assessment_ETH_B" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it.

By clicking on the drop-down button beside "Burn", you will see two blank boxes that will ask for an Address and Value to be deducted on your total tokens.

By clicking on the drop-down button beside "Mint", you will see two blank boxes that will ask for an Address and Value to be added on your total tokens.

By clicking on the button "tokenAbbrv", you will see the token name abbreviation which is "VCN"

By clicking on the button "tokenName", you will see the token name which is "VALTOKEN"

By clicking on the button "tokenName", you will see your total number of tokens.

Be advised that the total token value could never be below zero, so you can never have a negative amount of token.
